# Half5 - Automatic time registration and simple invoicing

With our timeline, you never have to guess how much time you spent on a task. Half5 provides peace of mind, focus on your work, and determine afterward how much time you spent on a task. With our advanced timeline, you suddenly know that you worked for another hour after 17:00 PM. That's easy money!

## Enable Timeline
- Bill forgotten hours
- Time tracking is no longer guesswork

## What does the timeline look like?
- All activities in one overview. Only on your computer.
- On the timeline, you can see a summary of what you spent most of your time on. You can use the timeline to add hours to your time registration.
- Your computer keeps track of which websites are open and which programs you have used. Of course, you can delete or adjust this data. You can also set that some programs or websites are not saved.

## 100% Privacy
- Locally stored, not in the cloud
- We understand that you don't want us (or your boss) to know what you are doing on your computer. That's why we only store the timeline data on your computer so that no one else can access it.

## Disable websites or programs
- Set which websites or programs are not saved. For example, you can exclude Social Media use from the timeline.
